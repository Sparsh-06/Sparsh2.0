    <p style="color: gray; font-size: 0.9rem;"><strong>Event:</strong> Vihaan 8.0, organized by IEEE at DTU</p>

  <section style="margin-bottom: 2rem;">
    <h2 style="font-size: 1.5rem; font-weight: 600; margin-bottom: 0.5rem;">‚úàÔ∏è The Beginning</h2>
    <p>
      It all began with a simple yet powerful ambition‚Äîto build something meaningful that could make a real difference. Vihaan 8.0, organized by IEEE at DTU, was the perfect stage. As a solo developer, I was aware of the uphill battle I was signing up for. Most participants were working in teams, each bringing together diverse skill sets. I, on the other hand, had to wear all the hats‚Äîdesigner, developer, planner, and problem-solver.
    </p>
    <p>
      But despite that, I saw this not as a challenge, but as an opportunity‚Äîa chance to push my limits, test my ideas, and see how far I could go on my own.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section style="margin-bottom: 2rem;">
    <h2 style="font-size: 1.5rem; font-weight: 600; margin-bottom: 0.5rem;">üß© The Challenge</h2>
    <p>
      Vihaan 8.0 attracted more than <strong>400+ developers and innovators</strong> across India. The competition was fierce. Every project presented was unique‚Äîranging from cutting-edge AI applications to community-based platforms and blockchain innovations.
    </p>
    <p>
      What set the top teams apart wasn‚Äôt just tech skills‚Äîit was the <strong>ability to think deeply, solve a real-world problem</strong>, and deliver a working solution within a limited timeframe. I knew my best shot was to <strong>focus on purpose and execution</strong> rather than just features.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section style="margin-bottom: 2rem;">
    <h2 style="font-size: 1.5rem; font-weight: 600; margin-bottom: 0.5rem;">üí° The Idea & Solution</h2>
    <p>
      I started by identifying a real-world problem that I could solve with a full-stack application‚Äîsomething that would combine good design, seamless functionality, and real impact. After brainstorming multiple directions, I settled on a solution that tackled both utility and scalability.
    </p>
    <ul style="padding-left: 1.5rem; margin-top: 0.5rem;">
      <li><strong>User-friendly:</strong> Clean UI/UX to ensure accessibility for all.</li>
      <li><strong>Efficient:</strong> Optimized backend performance to handle scale.</li>
      <li><strong>Innovative:</strong> Integrated tech in a way that simplified complexity.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      I chose a <strong>modern stack</strong> that would support quick iteration without compromising quality. From the architecture to the smallest design details, everything was built from scratch‚Äîwhile ensuring <strong>clean code, reusable components, and modular APIs</strong>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Throughout the sleepless nights, I stuck to three core principles:
    </p>
    <ol style="padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li>Solve a real problem.</li>
      <li>Build with clarity and intention.</li>
      <li>Ensure the end-user is always the priority.</li>
    </ol>
  </section>

  <section style="margin-bottom: 2rem;">
    <h2 style="font-size: 1.5rem; font-weight: 600; margin-bottom: 0.5rem;">üèÜ The Result</h2>
    <p>
      When the final results were announced, I was stunned. Out of <strong>400+ highly competitive participants</strong>, I secured the <strong>Second Position</strong>‚Äîas a <strong>solo developer</strong>. It was a moment of validation‚Äînot just of my technical abilities, but of the mindset I brought into the hackathon.
    </p>
    <p>
      This wasn‚Äôt just about winning a trophy. It was about proving to myself and others that:
    </p>
    <ul style="padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li>You don‚Äôt need a big team to create big impact.</li>
      <li>Execution and clarity matter more than size or flashiness.</li>
      <li>When your work aligns with real-world value, people notice.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section style="margin-bottom: 2rem;">
    <h2 style="font-size: 1.5rem; font-weight: 600; margin-bottom: 0.5rem;">‚ú® Key Takeaways</h2>
    <ul style="padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li><strong>Solve problems that matter:</strong> Don‚Äôt chase trends. Solve something real, even if it seems simple.</li>
      <li><strong>User experience is everything:</strong> Great functionality fails without great usability.</li>
      <li><strong>Innovation lies in simplicity:</strong> Sometimes, a small idea with clean execution beats complex systems.</li>
      <li><strong>Being solo isn‚Äôt a limitation‚Äîit‚Äôs a mindset:</strong> Focused effort, discipline, and vision can outpace numbers.</li>
      <li><strong>Perseverance is your secret weapon:</strong> Every moment of doubt or burnout is an opportunity to dig deeper.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      This experience has shaped my approach to problem-solving and product-building forever. I look forward to more challenges, more sleepless builds, and many more stories to tell.

    title: "Building Scalable React Applications: Lessons from the Field",
    content: `
      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>Building scalable React applications is both an art and a science. Through years of experience, I've learned valuable lessons that have helped me create more maintainable and performant applications.</p>
      
      <h2>Component Architecture</h2>
      <p>The way you structure your components can make or break your application's scalability. Here are some key principles I follow:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Keep components small and focused</li>
        <li>Use composition over inheritance</li>
        <li>Implement proper state management</li>
        <li>Optimize re-renders</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h2>Performance Optimization</h2>
      <p>Performance is crucial for user experience. Some techniques I use include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Code splitting</li>
        <li>Lazy loading</li>
        <li>Memoization</li>
        <li>Virtual scrolling for large lists</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h2>Testing and Maintenance</h2>
      <p>A robust testing strategy is essential for maintaining code quality. I recommend:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Unit tests for components</li>
        <li>Integration tests for features</li>
        <li>End-to-end tests for critical paths</li>
        <li>Regular code reviews</li>
      </ul>
